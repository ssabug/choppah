# Choppah

As I haven't found yet any trance gate VST for linux, DIY was the only way.

**IMPORTANT** For the moment the processing part has just started, so it sounds **CRAP**.

It is my very first JUCE project and i suck at C++ so...apologies for the crappy code ^^ .

## Description
![alt text](Ressources/images/GUI.png)
The chopper has 2 modes : pattern & sequence.

In **pattern** mode, the step seq current selected pattern is looping.It's the first line. 
You can change the pattern to play/edit with the upper left combo box.

In **sequence** mode, the choppers runs the combobox sequence of patterns.It's the second line.
The current sequence can be changed with the corresponding combobox to the left.
Note that pattern & sequence have a fixed length of 16.

You can adjust gate length, clock division for pattern mode only.

**Clear** button erases current selected pattern.

**Reset** erases all patterns.

**Copy** copies the current selected pattern.

**Paste** pastes the clipboard content into current pattern.If no copy was done, it is an empty pattern.

## Requirements
JUCE Version 7.0.7

gcc

## Installation
### Linux
 - get the pre-built **chopper.vst3** folder in **Releases** or build it (see below).
 - put it in your VST3 folder

## Building 
### Linux
 - git clone the repo or get a release zip.extract if necessary
 - in file **Builds/LinuxMakefile/Makefile** modify variable **JUCE_MODULES_INSTALLATION_DIR** to point to your juce module directory
 - build with `cd Builds/LinuxMakefile/ && clear && make clean && make`
 - the VST3 is the  **Builds/LinuxMakefile/build/chopper.vst3** directory
So far, tested on fedora.

  
## Change records
### 0.01 09092023 Initial release
- [x] draft GUI design
- [x] first implementation of basic chopper processing code
- [x] main processor parameters and controls definition
- [ ] dry/wet processing implementation
- [ ] gain slider custom range implementation
- [ ] pattern sequence management
- [ ] clicks as fuck : maybe its performance related, maybe switch gateMap to pointer
- [ ] problem with updating processor parameters via GUI // processor parameter change updating UI - ex : sometimes you try to change pattern on the GUI, it doesnt
- [ ] cannot attach custom lambda function to processor parameter, ex : the pattern# change to trigger gateMap update
